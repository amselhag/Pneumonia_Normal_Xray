Team members: Amro Elhag, Mounica pokala, Micheal Alrafati, Petros Paterakis

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Pneumonia is 
usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. 
This project is about diagnosing Pneumonia from X_Rays images of persons lungs. XRay images are imported from 
Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). Datasets contains 
We used four different models to find the best model that fits. 
Models used are: InceptionV3, Xception, VGG19, InceptionResnet.
By the highest accuracy of the model, we decided --- model to diagnose Pneumonia from XRay images.
